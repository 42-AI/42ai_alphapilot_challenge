# AlphaPilot
42AI's repository for the AlphaPilot challenge.

## AWS setup
To run our navigation algorithms and display the results in the FlightGoggles simulation, you need to setup a `p3.2xlarge` AWS instance and stream the output to your local machine. 
[A detailed tutorial](https://github.com/Talasta/AlphaPilot-WIP/tree/master/aws_scripts) is available in the aws_scripts folder of this repo, and will help you perform this setup. 

## Gate Detection
The first technical test of the AlphaPilot challenge (Test2) consists in developing a drone racing gate detection algorithm. The code and implementation details of our model are available in the [gate_detection](https://github.com/Talasta/AlphaPilot-WIP/tree/master/gate_detection) folder of this repository.

## Navigation
The second test of the AlphaPilot challenge (Test3) consists in developing an autonomous navigation algorithm. The code and implementation details of our model are available in the [route_planner](https://github.com/Talasta/AlphaPilot-WIP/tree/master/route_planner) folder of this repository.
